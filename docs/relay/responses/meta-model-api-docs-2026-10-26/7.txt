# Authentication

Every request to Meta Model API needs an API key. Add your key and start building.

## Get an API key

Create and manage keys in the [**Model API dashboard**](https://dev.meta.ai/):

1. Log in and open the **API keys** tab.
2. Click **Create API key**, give it a descriptive name, and click **Create**.
3. Copy the key right away. You only see it once.

API keys start with `LLM_`, followed by a numeric ID and the secret, separated by underscores:

```plaintext
LLM_1607358788850350_nx9.....LJY
```

## Use an API key

Pass the key as a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header:

**curl**

```shell
curl https://api.meta.ai/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MODEL_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "muse-spark-1.3",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}]
  }'
```

Keep the key out of your code. Store it in an environment variable:

```shell
export MODEL_API_KEY="LLM_1607358788850350_nx9.....LJY"
```

See [Get started](https://dev.meta.ai/docs/quickstart#first-call) for a full walkthrough.

> **NOTE: API keys and SDKs**
>
> Model API works with the OpenAI SDK, the Anthropic SDK, and OpenAI-compatible clients such as LangChain and LiteLLM. None of them reads `MODEL_API_KEY` on its own, so pass the key explicitly when you create the client. See [SDKs and libraries](https://dev.meta.ai/docs/sdks#authentication) for examples.

## Revoke an API key

Remove access in the **Model API dashboard**: click **Delete** next to the key you want to revoke. Deleting one key leaves other team keys untouched.

To rotate a key, create a new one, move your applications to it, and then delete the old key.

## API key safety

A leaked key can use up your team's rate limits, access uploaded files, and send requests on your behalf. Protect your keys with these practices:

1. **Use unique keys per application**: create a separate key for each app or developer so you can revoke one without breaking the rest.
2. **Keep keys out of client code**: mobile and browser code is visible to users. Proxy requests through a server you control.
3. **Never commit keys to version control**: load them from environment variables or a secrets manager, and add credential files to `.gitignore`.
4. **Use environment variables or a key manager**: centralize secrets so rotation stays simple and keys stay out of source files.
5. **Monitor for anomalies**: watch usage for unexpected spikes that suggest a leak, then revoke and rotate immediately.

> **NOTE: Shared team rate limits**
>
> Keys on the same team share rate limits. See [Pricing and rate limits](https://dev.meta.ai/docs/pricing-rate-limits) for details.
